Predict Car Price Based on Technical Features -sklearn.neighbors


we will predict cars' market prices based on information about technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.

The data we will use to train our model have multiple columns, most of which are features or attribute we will use to train our model, and 'price' column is target column we are predicting. Here are more detailed description about the data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile
